# MP_Algae_Project
Project repository for Microplastic and Algae Distribution in Coastal SC Stormwater Drainage Ponds research models and analysis

The objective of the project is to show the relationship in the distribution of MPs, Algae, Turbidity, and other measures of water quality.  The main questions to be answered include:

-What is the distribution of algae and microplastics within the drainage ponds?

-How does chlorophyll-a concentration change over the growing season?

-Does location within the pond (inlet, outlet, or middle) affect any of the variables?

-Does depth (surface or bottom) affect any of the variables?

The structure of the code-base is R. The data can be found in the data folder within this MP_Algae_Project repository. The data should be read in as a comma seperated value file.  The data contains: sampling date, sampling site, location within site, depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, turbidity, phycoyanin concentration, microplastic abundance, total dissolved nitrogen, and phycocyanin to chlorophyll-a ratio.

My results can be relpicated by using boxplot and occasionally ggplot to illustrate the relationship between different variables. I typically use linear models, with an assumed normal distribution.  

I would like to thank Dr. Barbara Beckingham for mentoring me.  I appreciate the help of Dane Buckhout, Regan Honeycutt, and Caroline Moore in sample collection.  I appreciate Dr. Dan McGlinn for help with the code and statistical analysis in this project.
